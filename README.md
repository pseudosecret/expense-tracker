# Expense Tracker

The best way to learn something is by doing it. I don't have a lot of experience with C++ or qt, so I thought I'd give them a go. Most of my experience is with Java and the like, so I thought this could be an interesting little project. Also, it would be good to document it.

Ultimately, this project is going to use the following bits of technology, at least in its basic stages:

* C++
* qt
* sqlite3

The idea is qt provides a nice platform for easy GUI construction. I then use C++ to connect what's happening in the GUI to the database.

I'm not 100% sure how it's going to work yet, but this is the basic idea:

1. Enter the expense.
2. Submit the expense.
3. Use menu to view expenses.

Maybe eventually I'll add some statistical elements. Not sure yet. Anyway, that's the gist of it.
